    <h1> Ode to NYC postcard!</h1>
    <h2>By Samantha Ortiz</h2>
    <p>For this project, I decided to create an ODE to NYC postcard. There's no place quite like it and I wanted to show my appreciation for the city that raised me. I designed a few simple well known NYC symbols that are lighthearted and fun. I created this composition fully in Adobe Illustrator using the pen and shape tool. In summary, this postcard symbolizes the hustle and bustle of NYC as well as the love I have for this city.</p>
